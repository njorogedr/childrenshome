Overview:
---------
This project implements a responsive web design for the Barrister Coffee Shop website. The goal is to provide an optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).

The design adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring usability and aesthetics are maintained regardless of the device.

Features:
---------
1. Fluid Grid Layout:
   - Uses relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels for layout and typography.
   
2. Flexible Images and Media:
   - Images scale with their containing elements without distortion.
   
3. Media Queries:
   - Custom CSS rules adapt styles for various screen widths.
   - Breakpoints at common device widths (e.g., 320px, 768px, 1024px).
   
4. Navigation:
   - Responsive navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
   
5. Typography:
   - Scalable font sizes for readability on all devices.
   
6. Touch-Friendly Elements:
   - Buttons and links are sized appropriately for touch interaction on mobile devices.
