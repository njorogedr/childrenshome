                     <h2>Why Foster Care Matters</h2>
                    <p>Founded in 2009, Every child deserves a loving, stable home where they can grow, learn, 
                        and reach their full potential. Foster care provides a vital safety net for children who cannot remain with their birth 
                        families due to circumstances beyond their control. At St. Dominic Foster Home, we are committed to creating an environment where
                         children feel valued, protected, and empowered to build bright futures.
                        Our comprehensive approach includes not only providing safe homes but also offering emotional support, educational
                         assistance,
                        and therapeutic services to help children heal from past trauma and develop the skills they need for successful
                         adulthood.</p>
