                    <h1>Why Foster Care Matters</h1>
                    <p>Founded in 2009, Every child deserves a loving, stable home where they can grow, learn, 
                        and reach their full potential. Foster care provides a vital safety net for children who cannot remain with their birth 
                        families due to circumstances beyond their control. At St. Dominic Foster Home, we are committed to creating an environment where
                         children feel valued, protected, and empowered to build bright futures.
                        Our comprehensive approach includes not only providing safe homes but also offering emotional support, educational
                         assistance,
                        and therapeutic services to help children heal from past trauma and develop the skills they need for successful
                         adulthood.</p>

            <div id="content-container" class="content-container">
                <div class="question">What are the requirements to become a foster parent?</div>
                <div class="answer">Foster parents must be at least 21 years old, have stable income and housing, 
                        pass background checks, complete training programs, and demonstrate the ability to provide a safe, nurturing environment.
                         Both single individuals and couples can apply, regardless of homeownership status or income level, as long as basic needs
                          can be met.</div>

            <div id="content-container" class="content-container">
                <div class="question">How long do children typically stay in foster care?</div>
                <div class="answer">The length of stay varies greatly depending on individual circumstances. Some children may be in care for a few weeks
                         while others may stay for several years. Our goal is always to work toward the best permanent solution for each child,
                          whether that's reunification with their birth family, adoption, or aging out with strong life skills and support
                          systems.</div>

            <div id="content-container" class="content-container">
                <div class="question">What support is provided to foster families?</div>
                <div class="answer">We provide comprehensive support including monthly financial assistance, 24/7 crisis support, ongoing training
                         opportunities, respite care, access to counseling services, educational advocacy, and regular case management. Our goal is to ensure foster families have all the resources they need to provide excellent care.</div>
            </div>

            <div id="content-container" class="content-container">
                <div class="question">Can foster children maintain contact with their birth families?</div>
                <div class="answer">Definitely! We strongly support maintaining connections with birth families through supervised visits,
                         phone calls, or other forms of contact. Family reunification is often the goal when possible, and maintaining these relationships can be crucial for the child's emotional well-being and identity development.</div>

            <div id="content-container" class="content-container">
                <div class="question">What happens when foster children turn 18?</div>
                <div class="answer">We provide transition planning and support services to help young adults aging out of foster care. This includes assistance with housing, education, employment, life skills training, and ongoing emotional support. Many of our programs continue to age 21 or beyond to ensure young adults have the foundation they need for independent living.</div>
