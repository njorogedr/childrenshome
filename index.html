                    <h1>Why Foster Care Matters</h1>
                    <p>Founded in 2009, Every child deserves a loving, stable home where they can grow, learn, 
                        and reach their full potential. Foster care provides a vital safety net for children who cannot remain with their birth 
                        families due to circumstances beyond their control. At St. Dominic Foster Home, we are committed to creating an environment where children feel valued, protected, and empowered to build bright futures.
                        Our comprehensive approach includes not only providing safe homes but also offering emotional support, educational assistance,
                        and therapeutic services to help children heal from past trauma and develop the skills they need for successful adulthood..</p>

                    <div class="faq-content">
                        Foster parents must be at least 21 years old, have stable income and housing, pass background checks, complete training programs, and demonstrate the ability to provide a safe, nurturing environment. Both single individuals and couples can apply, regardless of homeownership status or income level, as long as basic needs can be met.

                    <div class="faq-content">
                        The length of stay varies greatly depending on individual circumstances. Some children may be in care for a few weeks while others may stay for several years. Our goal is always to work toward the best permanent solution for each child, whether that's reunification with their birth family, adoption, or aging out with strong life skills and support systems.

                        We provide comprehensive support including monthly financial assistance, 24/7 crisis support, ongoing training opportunities, respite care, access to counseling services, educational advocacy, and regular case management. Our goal is to ensure foster families have all the resources they need to provide excellent care.

                    <summary>Can foster children maintain contact with their birth families?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-content">
                        When safe and appropriate, we strongly support maintaining connections with birth families through supervised visits, phone calls, or other forms of contact. Family reunification is often the goal when possible, and maintaining these relationships can be crucial for the child's emotional well-being and identity development.

                        We provide transition planning and support services to help young adults aging out of foster care. This includes assistance with housing, education, employment, life skills training, and ongoing emotional support. Many of our programs continue to age 21 or beyond to ensure young adults have the foundation they need for independent living.
